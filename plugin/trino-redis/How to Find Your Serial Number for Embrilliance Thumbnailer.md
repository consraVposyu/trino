## What is Embrilliance Thumbnailer and why do you need it?
 
Embrilliance Thumbnailer is a software that works with the Embrilliance Platform, a program that runs on your Mac or Windows computer and contains the features of several embroidery products, such as Essentials and StitchArtist. The Embrilliance Platform can be run without any serial numbers in Express Mode, which allows you to use thousands of embroidery fonts and designs that are published in the Embrilliance ".BX" installer format.
 
However, if you want to unlock more features and functionalities, such as resizing designs, merging your lettering with other stitch files, editing stitches, creating your own designs, and more, you will need to purchase and activate different products within the Embrilliance Platform using serial numbers. One of these products is Embrilliance Thumbnailer.
 
Embrilliance Thumbnailer is a software that enables you to view embroidery designs as thumbnails in your Windows Explorer or Mac Finder. This means that you don't have to open each file individually to see what it looks like. You can simply browse through your folders and see the designs as small images. This makes it easier to organize and find your embroidery files, especially if you have a large collection of designs from different sources.
 
Embrilliance Thumbnailer supports most embroidery file formats, such as PES, DST, EXP, JEF, HUS, VIP, VP3, ART, and more. It also supports ZIP files that contain embroidery designs. You can adjust the size and quality of the thumbnails according to your preferences. You can also view the design information, such as stitch count, color changes, hoop size, and file size by hovering over the thumbnail or right-clicking on it.
